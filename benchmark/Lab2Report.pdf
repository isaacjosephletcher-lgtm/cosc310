The fastest stack was the Arraylist which performed much faster in Workload2. This is probably
because of the constant memory allocation of creating and reallocating Nodes in the DLinkedListStack.
The fastest Queue was again the ArrayListQueue. This is probably due to the same reason as before;
however, Workload2 performed much slower on each test. This is because of the loss of branch
predictability, which led to more cache misses. Last, the BinaryHeapPQ performed exponentially
better than the other two. This is due to the fact that the the sort algorithm for the heap is much
more efficeint than the others. The heap did not have to search through the entire array unlike
the other PriorityQueues. This especailly plays out with larger workloads.
